Running DALiuGE
==========================
As discussed in :ref:`the previous section<installation>`, the translator and the engine are separate services and can be installed and run independently. 

Depending on how you are intending to run the system startup and shutdown is slightly different. The following options for start up and shutdown are given in alignment with the installation options: 

* :ref:`Docker <docker run>`
* :ref:`PyPI<running_with_cli>`
* :ref:`Source<running_with_cli>`


.. _docker run:

|daliuge| in Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The DALiUGE repository has scripts that are used to help run the Docker images. These can
be accessed with or without `git`. Using the shell scripts is not strictly necessary, but the docker command line is quite complex.

This can be acheived by cloning the repository::

  git clone https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge
  cd daliuge

If you would prefer not to use git, you can fetch the latest release artifacts::

  wget "$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/icrar/daliuge/releases/latest" \
        | grep "tarball_url" \
        | awk -F '"' '{print $4}')" -O daliuge-latest.tar.gz
      
  mkdir daliuge
  tar -xvf daliuge-latest.tar.gz -C daliuge --strip-components=1 

  cd daliuge

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Once you have access to the script code, you can run the start scripts for the translator::

   cd daliuge-translator
   ./run_translator.sh dev|dep

and the engine::

   cd daliuge-engine
   ./run_engine.sh dev|dep

The main difference between the development and the deployment version is that the development version is automatically strating a data island manager, while the deployment version is not doing that. Both are starting a Node Manager by default (see below).

.. _running_with_cli:

Running DALiuGE using the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If |daliuge| had been installed in a virtual environment of the host system it is possible to start the managers from the command line::

    dlg dim -H 0.0.0.0 -N localhost -d

and a node manager::

    dlg nm -H 0.0.0.0 -d 

To stop the managers use::

    dlg dim -s 

and::

    dlg nm -s 

respectively.

To run the translator::

    dlg lgweb -d /tmp/ -t /tmp/


The help for the complete CLI is available by just entering dlg at the prompt::

    ‚ùØ dlg
    Usage: /home/awicenec/.pyenv/versions/dlg/bin/dlg [command] [options]

    Commands are:

        fill                     Fill a Logical Graph with parameters
        include_dir              Print the directory where C header files can be found
        lgweb                    A Web server for the Logical Graph Editor
        map                      Maps a Physical Graph Template to resources and produces a Physical Graph
        mm                       Starts a Master Manager
        monitor                  A proxy to be used in conjunction with the dlg proxy in restricted environments
        nm                       Starts a Node Manager
        partition                Divides a Physical Graph Template into N logical partitions
        proxy                    A reverse proxy to be used in restricted environments to contact the Drop Managers
        replay                   Starts a Replay Manager
        submit                   Submits a Physical Graph to a Drop Manager
        unroll                   Unrolls a Logical Graph into a Physical Graph Template
        unroll-and-partition     unroll + partition
        version                  Reports the DALiuGE version and exits

    Try $PATH/bin/dlg [command] --help for more details

More details about the usage of the CLI can be found in the :ref:`cli_engine` chapter.
