DFMS is the Data Flow Management System prototype for SDP DATA.

SDP is the Science Data Process element of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
observatory. Its purpose is to process the output data of the SKA correlator in
soft-real time. This will be performed by a supercomputer that will continually
process data. A carefully planned execution plan will take place for reducing the
data of each observation.

The contepts in DFMS are designed after the SDP architecture and requirements.
In :doc:`overview` we give a glimpse to the main concepts present in DFMS.
Later sections of the documentation describe more in detail how dfms works.
