Graph development
=================

.. default-domain:: py

This section describes the different ways
users can develop workflows (either Logical or Physical)
to work with |daliuge|.

As explained in :doc:`architecture/graphs`,
|daliuge| describes computations
in terms of Directed Graphs.
Two different classes of graphs are used
in the |daliuge| workflow development:

#. *Logical Graphs*, a high-level, compact representation of the application logic. Logical Graphs are directed graphs, but not acyclic.
#. *Physical Graphs*, a detailed description of each individual processing step. Physical Graphs are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

When submitting a graph for execution,
users submit |pgs| to the runtime component of |daliuge|.
Therefore a |lg| needs to be first translated into a |pg|
before submitting it for execution.
The individual steps that occur during this translation process
are detailed in :ref:`graphs.translation`.

Given all the above,
the following graph development techniques are available
for users to creates graphs and submit them for execution:

#. :ref:`Use the Logical Graph Editor EAGLE <graph_dev.lge>`
   to create a |lg|, which can then be translated into a |pg|.
#. Manually, or automatically, :ref:`create a Physical Graph from scratch <graph_dev.pg>`.
#. :ref:`Use the delayed function <graph_dev.delayed>` to generate a |pg|.


.. _graph_dev.lge:

Using the Logical Graph Editor EAGLE
------------------------------------

Please refer to the `EAGLE documentation <https://eagle-dlg.readthedocs.io>`__ for detailed information.

.. _graph_dev.pg:

Directly creating a Physical Graph
----------------------------------

In some cases using EAGLE is not possible or not the preferred way of working.

In these cases, producing the Physical Graph directly
is still possible.
Once a Physical Graph is produced,
it can be partitioned and mapped
(see the steps in :ref:`graphs.translation`)
either via the |daliuge| utilities,
or by the user directly.
Finally, the Physical Graph can be sent
to a Drop Island Manager
for execution.

.. _graph_dev.delayed:

Using :func:`dlg.delayed`
-------------------------

|daliuge| ships with a `Dask <https://dask.org/>`__ emulation layer
that allows users write code
like they would for using under Dask,
but that executes under |daliuge| instead.
In Dask users write normal python code
to represent their computation.
This code is not executed immediately though;
instead its execution is *delayed*
by wrapping the function calls
with the ``delayed`` `Dask function <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/delayed.html>`__,
until a final ``compute`` call is invoked,
at which point the computation is submitted to the Dask runtime agents.
These agents execute the computation logic
and return a result to the user.

To emulate Dask,
|daliuge| also offers a ``delayed`` function
(under ``dlg.delayed``)
that allows users to write normal python code.
The usage pattern is exactly the same
as that of Dask:
users wrap their function calls with the ``delayed`` function,
and end up calling the ``compute`` method
to be obtain the final result.

Under the hood,
|daliuge| returns intermediate placeholder objects
on each invocation to ``delayed``.
When ``compute`` is invoked,
these objects are used to compute a Physical Graph,
which is then submitted to one of the Drop Managers
for execution.
|daliuge| doesn't have the concept
of returning the final result back to the user.
In order to imitate this,
a final application is appended automatically
to the Physical Graph before submission.
This final application allows the ``compute`` function
to connect to it.
Once this final application receives the final result
of the Physical Graph
it then sends it to the ``compute`` function,
who presents the result to the user.
