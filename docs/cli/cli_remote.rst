Remote Deployment Commands
##########################
The DALiuGE CLI provides support for submitting graphs to a remote environment, such as a local network cluster, a supercomputing facility, or even the cloud. 

The following assumptions are made prior to discussing Remote Deployment: 

- DALiuGE is already installed within a Python virtual environment in the remote cluster
- All required libraries and data is available in the remote cluster, either before or during the execution of the graph. 
- The cluster is running SLURM.

Remote deployment support in DALiuGE creates a SLURM job that starts up a DALiuGE engine on the nodes allocated to the SLURM job. This requires setting up the remote submission and any additional parameters you want to have for the SLURM-DALiUGE job. 

The following sections detail how to configure a remote submission and how to submit the graph using the CLI. 

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    Custom environment configuration is in 'beta' at the moment and there may still be rough edges. Please consider `submitting an issue <https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge/issues/new/choose>`_ if you identify one. 

Remote deploment setup occurs from your local DALiuGE installtion. 

The folling command initiates the remote setup::   

    dlg config --setup

    > Do you want to create a $HOME/.config/dlg directory to store your custom configuration files and scripts  (y/n)?

Selecting ``y`` will set up the config directory, along with the default environ ini files and the slurm submission scripts::

    User Configs (~/.config/dlg)
    ----------------------------
    Environments (--config_file):
        setonix.ini
        default.ini
    Slurm scripts (--slurm_template):
        default.slurm
        setonix.slurm

    DALiuGE Defaults (-f/--facility):
    -----------------------------------
        galaxy_mwa
        galaxy_askap
        magnus
        galaxy
        setonix
        shao
        hyades
        ood
        ood_cloud

The above can be listed at any time after initially created using the ``list`` option:

    dlg config --list

The idea behind the User configurations and Slurm templates is that individual runtime requirements will differ between users and between graphs. 
    
Custom Environments 
===================

The custom environment files allow you to set parameters for the remote environment which will be used during submission of the batch job. This includes things like username, login node, virtual environment etc. 

It is recommended to start with the default.ini file provided in the User config directory, and edit it according to what works for your situation.

Custom SLURM scripts
====================

It is possible you need to do more with your DALiUGE SLURM submission than the basics; for example, if your graph being submitted requires additional environments to be loaded. Like the custom environments, we recommend starting with the default.slurm file and then customising it according to your needs. The setonix.slurm example may provide useful guidance on how we have customised a submission for our own local HPC system. 
    
Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^

The precedence order for default submission is:
    - Facility (-f) 
    - Environment config (--config-file) will overwrite Facility
    - SLURM template (--slurm_template) will overwrite Environment

Thus some environment variables that may be set in the ``.ini`` file will be overwritten if a SLURM template file is used that also defines those variables. 

The following is a complete example::

    dlg remote-submit -a submit 
    -L <my_logical_graph>
    -v 5 --remote --submit 
    --config_file setonix.ini --slurm_template setonix.slurm
