DFMS
####

Welcome to the Data Flow Management System (DFMS).

DFMS is an on-going prototyping activity that is part of the `SDP Consortium
<https://www.skatelescope.org/sdp/>`_. It aims to prototype the main risk items
of the proposed SDP architecture to confirm the design choices and the
different product selection. At the same time, DFMS is written in such a way
that it can be reused by any other project needing its functionality.

Development and maintenance of DFMS is currently hosted at ICRAR_.
