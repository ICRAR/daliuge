Welcome to the Data Activated 流 [#f1]_ Graph Engine (|daliuge|).

|daliuge| (previously known as DFMS, the Data Flow Management System)
is an on-going prototyping activity that is part of the `SDP Consortium
<https://www.skatelescope.org/sdp/>`_. It aims to prototype the main risk items
of the proposed SDP architecture to confirm the design choices and the
different product selection. At the same time, |daliuge| is written in such a way
that it can be reused by any other project needing its functionality.

Development and maintenance of |daliuge| is currently hosted at ICRAR_
and is performed by the `DIA team <http://www.icrar.org/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy/>`_.
