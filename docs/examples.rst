Using the EAGLE
###############

The *Editor for the Advanced Graph Language Environment* (EAGLE) is a web application supporting the development of complex processing workflows. In |daliuge| workflows are described as a series of graphs and EAGLE is producing a graph description using a JSON schema. EAGLE can be used to submit that graph to the |daliuge| translator REST interface, but it is also possible to save the graph and use command line tools to submit that graph. 

EAGLE has been split-off from the rest of the |daliuge| code to assist with the stand-alone maintenance and deployment of this part of the |daliuge| system. The EAGLE documentation is installed as part of EAGLE and accessible through the EAGLE web-interface but also `here <https://eagle-dlg.readthedocs.io>`_.
