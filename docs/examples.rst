Using the EAGLE
###############

The *Editor for the Advanced Graph Language Environment* (EAGLE) is a web application supporting the development of complex processing workflows. In |daliuge| workflows are described as a series of graphs and EAGLE is producing a graph description using a JSON schema. Please refer to the :ref:`graphs` section for more details on graphs. 

EAGLE has been split-off from the rest of the |daliuge| code to assist with the stand-alone maintenance and deployment of this part of the |daliuge| system. The EAGLE documentation is installed as part of EAGLE and accessible through the EAGLE web-interface but also `here <http://eagle.icrar.org/static/docs/build/html/index.html>`_.
