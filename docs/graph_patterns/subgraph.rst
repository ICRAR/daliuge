Subgraph
--------

The Subgraph construct allows for the representation of complete graphs as a single component in 'super' graph. Currently, the feature can be used to import existing graphs from the Repository tab onto the current graph canvas. This can be acheived by clicking the **[+]** icon that appears next to the graph file name when you hover the mouse over it. 

Future work will support the deployment of subgraphs within a super graph.
