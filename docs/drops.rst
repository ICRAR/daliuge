Drops
-----

Drops are at the center of the |daliuge|. Drops are representations of data and
applications, making them manageable by |daliuge|.

Lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^

The lifecycle of a Drop is simple and follows the basic principle of writing
once, read many times. Additionally, it also allows for data deletion.

A Drop starts in the **INITIALIZED** state, meaning that its data is not
present yet. From there it jumps into **COMPLETED** once its data has been
written, optionally passing through **WRITING** if the writing occurs
*through* |daliuge| (see `Input/Output`_). Once in the **COMPLETED** state the data
can be read as many times as needed. Eventually, the Drop will transition to
**EXPIRED**, denying any further reads. Finally the data is deleted and the Drop
moves to the final **DELETED** state. If any I/O error occurs the Drop will be
moved to the **ERROR** state.

.. _drop.events:

Events
^^^^^^

Changes in a Drop state, and other actions performed on a Drop, will fire named
events which are sent to all the interested subscribers. Users can subscribe to
particular named events, or to all events.

In particular the :ref:`node_drop_manager` subscribes to all events generated by
the Drops it manages. By doing so it can monitor all their activities and perform
any appropriate action as required. The Node Drop Manager, or any other entity,
can thus become a Graph Event Manager, in the sense that they can subscribe to
all events sent by all Drops and make use of them.

.. _drop.relationships:

Relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drops are connected between them and create a graph representing an execution
plan, where inputs and outputs are connected to applications, establishing the
following possible relationships:

* None or many data Drop(s) can be the *input* of an application Drop; and
  the application is the *consumer* of the data Drop(s).
* A data Drop can be a *streaming input* of an application
  Drop in which case the application is seen as a *streaming consumer* from
  the data Drop's point of view.
* None or many Drop(s) can be the *output* of an application Drop, in
  which case the application is the *producer* of the data Drop(s).
* An application is never a consumer or producer of another application; 
  conversely a data Drop never produces or consumes another data Drop. 

The difference between *normal* inputs/consumers and their *streaming*
counterpart is their granularity. In the normal case, inputs only notify their
consumers when they have reached the **COMPLETED** state, after which the
consumers can open the Drop and read their data. Streaming inputs on
the other hand notify consumers each time data is written into them (alongside
with the data itself), and thus
allow for a continuous operation of applications as data gets written into
their inputs. Once all the data has been written, the normal event notifying
that the Drop has moved to the **COMPLETED** state is also fired.

.. _drop.io:

Input/Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^

I/O can be performed on the data that is represented by a Drop by obtaining a
reference to its I/O object and calling the necessary POSIX-like methods.  In
this case, the data is passing through the Drop instance. The application is
free to bypass the Drop interface and perform I/O directly on the data, in which
case it uses the data Drop ``dataURL`` to find out the data location.  It is the
responsibility of the application to ensure that the I/O is occurring in the
correct location and using the expected format for storage or subsequent
upstream processing by other application Drops.

|daliuge| provides various commonly used data Drops with their associated I/O
storage classes, including in-memory, file-base and S3 storages.

.. _drop.channels:

Drop Channels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drops that are connected by an edge in a physical graph but are deployed on separate nodes or islands from each other are automatically given a Pyro stub (remote method invocation interface) to allow them to communicate with each other. It's the job of the Master Drop and Island Managers to generate and exchange stubs between Drop instances before the graph is deployed to the various data islands and nodes within islands respectively. If there is no Drop separation within a physical graph partition then its implied that the Drops are going to be executed within a single address space, as a result, basic method calls are used between Drop instances.


.. _drop.component.iface:

Drop Component Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |daliuge| framework uses Docker containers as its primary interface to 3rd party applications. Docker containers have the following benefits over traditional tools management:

* Portability.
* Versioning and component reuse.
* Lightweight footprint.
* Simple maintenance.

The application programmer can make use of the :ref:`DockerApp
<api.dlg.apps.dockerapp>` which is the interface between a Docker container and
the Drop framework. Refer to the documentation for details.

Other applications not based on Docker containers can be written as well. Any
application must derive at least from ``AppDrop``, but an easier-to-use base
class is the ``BarrierAppDrop``, which simply requires a ``run`` method to be
written by the developer (see :ref:`api.dlg.Drop` for details). |daliuge| ships with
a set of pre-existing applications to perform common operations, like a TCP
socket listener and a bash command executor, among others. See :ref:`api.dlg.apps`
for more examples.
