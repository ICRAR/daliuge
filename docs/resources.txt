dispy	http://dispy.sourceforge.net/
sequoia	http://web.stanford.edu/group/sequoia/
X10	http://x10-lang.org/home/introduction1.html

section 2.1 and 2.2 of this paper has a good overview of sequoia and X10

While X10 has some concepts such as “places” similar to data island, Sequoia compiler maps a program (i.e. the logical graph) onto a (parallel or distributed) memory hierarchy tree based on a “predefined distributions of both data and tasks at compile time”.
