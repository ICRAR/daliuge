The Data Flow Management System (DFMS) prototype represents the **execution framework**
of the Science Data Processor (SDP) element of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) observatory.
DFMS aims to provide a distributed data management platform and a
scalable pipeline execution environment to support continuous, soft real-time,
data-intensive processing for producing SKA science ready products.
