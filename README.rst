|daliuge|
is an on-going prototyping activity that is part of the `SDP Consortium
<https://www.skatelescope.org/sdp/>`_. It aims to prototype the execution framework
of the proposed SDP architecture. Furthermore, |daliuge| has already been used
for `processing large astronomical datasets <https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07617>`_
in existing radio astronomy projects.

Development and maintenance of |daliuge| is currently hosted at ICRAR_
and is performed by the `DIA team <http://www.icrar.org/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy/>`_.

See the ``docs/`` directory for more information, or visit `our online
documentation <https://daliuge.readthedocs.io/>`_
