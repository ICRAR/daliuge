|daliuge|
is a workflow graph development, management and execution framework, specifically designed to support very large
scale processing graphs for the reduction of interferometric radio astronomy data sets.
|daliuge| has already been used for `processing large astronomical datasets 
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07617>`_ in existing radio astronomy projects.
It originated from a prototyping activity as part of the `SDP Consortium
<https://www.skatelescope.org/sdp/>`_ called Data Flow Management System (DFMS). DFMS aimed to 
prototype the execution framework of the proposed SDP architecture.

For more information about the installation and usage of the system please refer to the `documentation <https://daliuge.readthedocs.io>`_


Development and maintenance of |daliuge| is currently hosted at ICRAR_
and is performed by the `DIA team <http://www.icrar.org/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy/>`_.

See the ``docs/`` directory for more information, or visit `our online
documentation <https://daliuge.readthedocs.io/>`_
