class AbstractDROP(EventFirer, EventHandler):
    """
    Base class for all DROP implementations.

    A DROP is a representation of a piece of data. DROPs are created,
    written once, potentially read many times, and they finally potentially
    expire and get deleted. Subclasses implement different storage mechanisms
    to hold the data represented by the DROP.

    If the data represented by this DROP is written *through* this object
    (i.e., calling the ``write`` method), this DROP will keep track of the
    data's size and checksum. If the data is written externally, the size and
    checksum can be fed into this object for future reference.

    DROPs can have consumers attached to them. 'Normal' consumers will
    wait until the DROP they 'consume' (their 'input') moves to the
    COMPLETED state and then will consume it, most typically by opening it
    and reading its contents, but any other operation could also be performed.
    How the consumption is triggered depends on the producer's `executionMode`
    flag, which dictates whether it should trigger the consumption itself or
    if it should be manually triggered by an external entity. On the other hand,
    streaming consumers receive the data that is written into its input
    *as it gets written*. This mechanism is driven always by the DROP that
    acts as a streaming input. Apart from receiving the data as it gets
    written into the DROP, streaming consumers are also notified when the
    DROPs moves to the COMPLETED state, at which point no more data should
    be expected to arrive at the consumer side.

    DROPs' data can be expired automatically by the system after the DROP has
    transitioned to the COMPLETED state if they are created by a DROP Manager.
    Expiration can either be triggered by an interval relative to the creation
    time of the DROP (via the `lifespan` keyword), or by specifying that the
    DROP should be expired after all its consumers have finished (via the
    `expireAfterUse` keyword). These two methods are mutually exclusive. If none
    is specified no expiration occurs.
