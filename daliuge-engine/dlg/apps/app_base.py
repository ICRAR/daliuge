class AppDROP(ContainerDROP):
    """
    An AppDROP is a DROP representing an application that reads data
    from one or more DataDROPs (its inputs), and writes data onto one or more
    DataDROPs (its outputs).

    AppDROPs accept two different kind of inputs: "normal" and "streaming"
    inputs. Normal inputs are DataDROPs that must be on the COMPLETED state
    (and therefore their data must be fully written) before this application is
    run, while streaming inputs are DataDROPs that feed chunks of data into
    this application as the data gets written into them.

    This class contains two methods that need to be overwritten by
    subclasses: `dropCompleted`, invoked when input DataDROPs move to
    COMPLETED, and `dataWritten`, invoked with the data coming from streaming
    inputs.

    How and when applications are executed is completely up to the app component
    developer, and is not enforced by this base class. Some applications might need
    to be run at `initialize` time, while other might start during the first invocation
    of `dataWritten`. A common scenario anyway is to start an application only
    after all its inputs have moved to COMPLETED (implying that none of them is
    an streaming input); for these cases see the `BarrierAppDROP`.

    """
    An InputFiredAppDROP accepts no streaming inputs and waits until a given
    amount of inputs (called *effective inputs*) have moved to COMPLETED to
    execute its 'run' method, which must be overwritten by subclasses. This way,
    this application allows to continue the execution of the graph given a
    minimum amount of inputs being ready. The transitions of subsequent inputs
    to the COMPLETED state have no effect.

    Normally only one call to the `run` method will happen per application.
    However users can override this by specifying a different number of tries
    before finally giving up.

    The amount of effective inputs must be less or equal to the amount of inputs
    added to this application once the graph is being executed. The special
    value of -1 means that all inputs are considered as effective, in which case
    this class acts as a BarrierAppDROP, effectively blocking until all its
    inputs have moved to the COMPLETED, SKIPPED or ERROR state. Setting this
    value to anything other than -1 or the number of inputs, results in
    late arriving inputs to be ignored, even if they would successfully finish.
    This requires careful implementation of the upstream and downstream apps to
    deal with this situation. It is only really useful to control a combination
    of maximum allowed execution time and acceptable number of completed inputs.

    An input error threshold controls the behavior of the application given an
    error in one or more of its inputs (i.e., a DROP moving to the ERROR state).
    The threshold is a value within 0 and 100 that indicates the tolerance
    to erroneous effective inputs, and after which the application will not be
    run but moved to the ERROR state itself instead.
