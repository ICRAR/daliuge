    A BarrierAppDROP that copies the content of its single input onto its
    single output via SSH's scp protocol.

    Because of the nature of the scp protocol, the input and output DROPs
    of this application must both be filesystem-based; i.e., they must be an
    instance of FileDROP or of DirectoryContainer.

    Depending on the physical location of each DROP (this application, and
    its input and outputs) this application will copy data FROM another host or
    TO other host. This application's node must thus coincide with one of the
    two I/O DROPs.
