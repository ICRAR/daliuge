    A DROP graph execution.

    A session is the runtime incarnation of a given DROP graph that gets
    executed in our framework. Thus, different executions of the same graph
    parts or specifications lead to different sessions.

    In order to be flexible enough, a session starts in a PRISTINE status. While
    in PRISTINE status "graph parts" can be added to it in separate calls, which
    can be connected later. The first time a "graph part" is added to the
    session its status is changed to BUILDING. Once all the parts have been
    submitted, users can finally deploy the session, which will move the session
    to the DEPLOYING status first, create the actual DROPs, and then move
    the session to the RUNNING status later. Once the execution of the
    graph has finished the session is moved to FINISHED.
