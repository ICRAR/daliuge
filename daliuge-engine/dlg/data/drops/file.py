    A DROP that points to data stored in a mounted filesystem.

    Users can fix both the path and the name of a FileDrop using the `filepath`
    parameter for each FileDrop. We distinguish four cases and their combinations.

    1) If not specified the filename will be generated.
    2) If it has a '/' at the end it will be treated as a directory name and the
       filename will the generated.
    3) If it does not end with a '/' and it is not an existing directory, it is
       treated as dirname plus filename.
    4) If filepath points to an existing directory, the filename will be generated

    In all cases above, if `filepath` does not start with '/â€™ (relative path)
    then the session directory will be pre-pended to make the path absolute.
