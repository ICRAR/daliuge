class FileDROP(DataDROP, PathBasedDrop):
    """
    A DROP that points to data stored in a mounted filesystem.

    Users can (but usually don't need to) specify both a `filepath` and a
    `dirname` parameter for each FileDrop. The combination of these two parameters
    will determine the final location of the file backed up by this drop on the
    underlying filesystem. When no ``filepath`` is provided, the drop's UID will be
    used as a filename. When a relative filepath is provided, it is relative to
    ``dirname``. When an absolute ``filepath`` is given, it is used as-is.
    When a relative ``dirname`` is provided, it is relative to the base directory
    of the currently running session (i.e., a directory with the session ID as a
    name, placed within the currently working directory of the Node Manager
    hosting that session). If ``dirname`` is absolute, it is used as-is.

    In some cases drops are created **outside** the context of a session, most
    notably during unit tests. In these cases the base directory is a fixed
    location under ``/tmp``.

    The following table summarizes the calculation of the final path used by
    the ``FileDrop`` class depending on its parameters:

    ============ ===================== ===================== ==========
         .                               filepath
    ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
    dirname      empty                 relative              absolute
    ============ ===================== ===================== ==========
    **empty**    /``$B``/``$u``        /``$B``/``$f``        /``$f``
    **relative** /``$B``/``$d``/``$u`` /``$B``/``$d``/``$f`` **ERROR**
    **absolute** /``$d``/``$u``        /``$d``/``$f``        **ERROR**
    ============ ===================== ===================== ==========

    In the table, ``$f`` is the value of ``filepath``, ``$d`` is the value of
    ``dirname``, ``$u`` is the drop's UID and ``$B`` is the base directory for
    this drop's session, namely ``/the/cwd/$session_id``.
