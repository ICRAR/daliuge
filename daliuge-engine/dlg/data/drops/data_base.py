    A DataDROP is a DROP that stores data for writing with
    an AppDROP, or reading with one or more AppDROPs.

    DataDROPs have two different modes: "normal" and "streaming".
    Normal DataDROPs will wait until the COMPLETED state before being
    available as input to an AppDROP, while streaming AppDROPs may be
    read simutaneously with writing by chunking drop bytes together.

    This class contains two methods that need to be overrwritten:
    `getIO`, invoked by AppDROPs when reading or writing to a drop,
    and `dataURL`, a getter for a data URI uncluding protocol and address
    parsed by function `IOForURL`.
