    Checks that the port specified by ``host``:``port`` is either open or
    closed (depending on the value of ``checking_open``) within a given
    ``timeout``.
    When checking for an open port, this method will keep trying to connect to
    it either until the given ``timeout`` has expired or until the socket is
    found open. When checking for a closed port this method will keep trying to
    connect to it until the connection is unsuccessful, or until the ``timeout``
    expires.
    Additionally, if some ``data`` is passed and the method is ``checking_open``
    then ``data`` will be written to the socket if it connects successfully.

    This method returns ``True`` if the port was found on the expected state
    within the time limit, and ``False`` otherwise.
